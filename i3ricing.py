        With multiple containers in a horizontal split (siblings) the above command moves the focused container right
        within the siblings. However if the focused container is the rightmost sibling, it will jump to the next output
        (not the next workspace as I would expect). This is annoying as it even ignores existing workspaces on the
        originating output.

        command:

        However it is not available in the `move` command and the `focus next sibling` command will not change the focus
        across workspaces.
